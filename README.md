# ðŸ“š Oneling Bot

Oneling Bot is a Telegram bot designed to help you memorize information using regular reminders. This method optimizes retention through spaced repetition.

## ðŸ”¥ Features

- **List Reminders:** `/list`
- **Clear Reminders:** `/clear`
- **Set Intervals:** `/set_intervals {intervals}`
- **Show Intervals:** `/show_intervals`

The default intervals are '5m 30m 2h 12h 2d', meaning a reminder will trigger first after 5 minutes, then after 30 minutes, and so on.

To add a new reminder, simply type the value in the chat.
