# ðŸ“š Oneling Bot

Oneling Bot is a Telegram bot designed to help you memorize information using reminders based on the forgetting curve theory. This method optimizes retention through spaced repetition.

## ðŸ”¥ Features

- **Add Reminders:** `/add {value}` or simply type the value in chat.
- **Remove Reminders:** `/remove {value}`
- **List Reminders:** `/list`
- **Clear Reminders:** `/clear`
- **Set Intervals:** `/set_intervals {intervals}`
- **Show Intervals:** `/show_intervals`

The default intervals are: 5 minutes, 30 minutes, 2 hours, 12 hours, 2 days. This means a reminder will first occur 5 minutes after you add it, then 30 minutes later, and so on.
